# Project Status

## Task 36/60 — Focus Plans Core + Draft/Active Lifecycle (complete)

- Closed slice: `026-focus-plans-core`.
- Feature checkpoint: `57bd42d8eed5643d2fee3b04f74bd3c44e738da2`.
- Canonical model: standalone Focus Plan entity.
- Schema 20 is active through an append-only migration; migrations 1–19 remain unchanged.
- Backend core, IPC, tags, Search, backup/restore, generated bindings, Plans UI, recovery-draft loading, and native smoke scenarios are implemented.
- Focused frontend typecheck/tests, Rust migration/core/backup/tag/Search tests, generated-binding stability, diff checks, production frontend build, and repository governance passed during Task 36 stabilization.
- Persisted SQLite artifacts confirmed committed Plan state, lifecycle, outcome, phase ordering, and revision updates.
- Native Windows restart automation is non-blocking tooling coverage. Its harness failures did not demonstrate a reproducible product defect and do not keep Task 36 open.
- Runtime patch scripts and all temporary Task 36 workflows were removed.
- GitHub Actions on `main` contains only the sealed manual, read-only Windows installer build.
- Today remains startup/default; Life semantics remain unchanged.
- No Task 37 relation, review workflow, or automatic progress behavior entered schema 20.

Task 36 is hard-closed. Reopen only for a reproducible product defect, migration/data-loss risk, violated invariant, or explicit Product Owner decision.

## Task 37/60 — Focus Plan ↔ Task Integration + Review Workflow

Not started. Requires a separate Product Owner activation.

## Historical status

Task 1–33 history remains preserved at [`docs/status-history/STATUS-through-task33.md`](status-history/STATUS-through-task33.md). Task 34–35 evidence remains in accepted ADR and audit records.
