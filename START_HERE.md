## Task 36 closure

Task 36 is closed and must not be reopened merely because a native E2E smoke test or Windows driver harness is red. Closure is supported by implemented schema/domain/UI behavior, focused frontend coverage, Rust migration/core/backup/tag/Search tests, generated-binding stability, production frontend build, inspected persisted SQLite artifacts, and explicit Product Owner acceptance.

A future reproducible product defect, migration/data-loss risk, violated invariant, or explicit Product Owner decision may reopen the task. Tooling-only failures remain non-blocking verification debt.

## Sealed workflow

GitHub Actions contains one manual, read-only Windows installer build. Normal feature, fix, refactor, test, documentation, and maintenance tasks must not modify `.github/workflows/` or `.github/WORKFLOW_SEAL.sha256`. Workflow changes require explicit Product Owner authorization and must pass `python scripts/check_repository.py`.
