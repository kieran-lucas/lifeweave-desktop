# Project Status

## Task 38/60 — One-Off Task Deadline Semantics + Deadline Queue (active)

- Activation baseline: `954b596677c34dd20ce3d0807d36b20676114f2b`.
- Active spec: `specs/028-one-off-deadline-semantics`.
- Decision basis: ADR 0028 scored Deadline Semantics highest and framed a one-off-only first slice; ADR 0029 deferred it behind Focus Plans, which are now complete.
- Scope: optional date-only deadline on one-off Tasks, plus a bounded Deadlines tab in the Today workspace.
- Schema moves from 21 to 22 through an append-only migration; migrations 1–21 remain unchanged.
- Deadline authority is `tasks.deadline_local_date` only; recurring series, occurrences, overrides, and evaluations own no deadline.
- Schedule and deadline stay independent; scheduling after a deadline is surfaced, never repaired.
- Existing Overdue keeps its schedule-based meaning and is not renamed; Today remains startup/default and Task rows remain non-card.
- Task 39 is prohibited: no reminders, notifications, scheduling, deadline analytics, prediction, Saved Views, or new destination.
- Closure requires deterministic migration, mutation, state, queue, Search, and backup evidence, a full diff audit, and a primary structured review with no confirmed P0/P1 defect.

## Task 37/60 — Focus Plan ↔ Task Integration + Manual Review History (complete)

- Closed slice: `027-focus-plan-task-review`.
- Feature checkpoint: `09c393737fd6f096780408a803aea9b6e1355bb8`.
- Canonical decision: ADR 0031.
- Schema 21 is active through an append-only migration; migrations 1–20 remain unchanged.
- Relationship authority is stored on `tasks` and `task_series`; occurrences, overrides, and evaluations inherit and own nothing.
- All three recurring edit scopes hold: occurrence scope cannot change the relation, entire-series owns it absolutely, and a this-and-future split keeps the old series relation while the new series inherits or takes an explicit forward choice.
- An existing link survives Plan archive and unrelated edits, projects explicitly as archived, and returns to ordinary projection on restore.
- Manual reviews are create-and-read only, idempotent by `operation_id`, bounded newest-first, and change no Plan state.
- Rust format/clippy/tests (546 serial), frontend typecheck/tests (573), production frontend build, generated-binding stability, and repository governance passed.
- Migration, close/reopen, and full backup/restore round-trip evidence covers relations and reviews.
- Today remains startup/default, Task rows remain non-card, and Life semantics remain unchanged.
- The separate independent-review agent could not run: its environment hit a session quota. An equivalent structured review was performed directly and is recorded as disclosed verification debt.
- No workflow, seal, dependency, lockfile, or capability-scope drift entered the change.

Task 37 is closed. Reopen only for a reproducible product defect, migration/data-loss risk, violated invariant, or explicit Product Owner decision.

## Task 36/60 — Focus Plans Core + Draft/Active Lifecycle (complete)

- Closed slice: `026-focus-plans-core`.
- Feature checkpoint: `57bd42d8eed5643d2fee3b04f74bd3c44e738da2`.
- Canonical model: standalone Focus Plan entity.
- Schema 20 is active through an append-only migration; migrations 1–19 remain unchanged.
- Backend core, IPC, tags, Search, backup/restore, generated bindings, Plans UI, recovery-draft loading, and native smoke scenarios are implemented.
- Focused frontend typecheck/tests, Rust migration/core/backup/tag/Search tests, generated-binding stability, diff checks, production frontend build, and repository governance passed during Task 36 stabilization.
- Persisted SQLite artifacts confirmed committed Plan state, lifecycle, outcome, phase ordering, and revision updates.
- Native Windows restart automation is non-blocking tooling coverage. Its harness failures did not demonstrate a reproducible product defect and do not keep Task 36 open.
- Runtime patch scripts and all temporary Task 36 workflows were removed.
- GitHub Actions on `main` contains only the sealed manual, read-only Windows installer build.
- Today remains startup/default; Life semantics remain unchanged.
- No Task 37 relation, review workflow, or automatic progress behavior entered schema 20.

Task 36 is hard-closed. Reopen only for a reproducible product defect, migration/data-loss risk, violated invariant, or explicit Product Owner decision.

## Task 39/60

Not started. Requires a separate Product Owner activation.

## Historical status

Task 1–33 history remains preserved at [`docs/status-history/STATUS-through-task33.md`](status-history/STATUS-through-task33.md). Task 34–35 evidence remains in accepted ADR and audit records.
